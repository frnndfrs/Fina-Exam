# Final-Reflection 
During these 5 weeks I learned that programming is a very useful tool that helps optimize proceses in a series of topics. We were taught that mathematical problems in a company can be properly solved by using programming tools. You can solve many different type of problems as well as make predictions and evaluate data; we solved linear models and regressions in the elaboration of the first two minicases, we also learned about the different programs and how to interpret metrics. In conclusion, I found this class very interesting and useful even if at first I did'nt understand the contents that well, I felt good when my code ran and lastly I think that all of these things that I learned are going to help me better solve many other problems that come during my education process.
